\description{
\code{setompthreads()} Uses a function in the "setthreads.so" shared library
built into LBD Singularity images to set the number of OMP threads to a user
defined value
}
\details{
Uses a function in the "setthreads.so" shared library built into LBD
Singularity images to set the number of OMP threads to a user defined value.
The shared library should exist in the LBD Singularity image and should have
already been loaded by \code{mbg_setup()}. This function checks to make sure
that it is loaded and if not, attempts to use \code{load_setthreads()} to do
so. A warning is generated if this is run outside of an LBD Singularity image
and no thread adjustment is done.

\dontrun{
setompthreads(2) # sets the OMP threads to 2

This function depends on:
\code{\link{load_setthreads()}}
\code{\link{is_integer()}}
Is used by:
\code{\link{set_serial_threads()}}
\code{\link{set_original_threads()}}
And is related to:
\code{\link{get_omp_threads()}}
MKL thread setting is done with \code{\link{setmklthreads}}
